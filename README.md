# PolarityPuzzle
This project is a solver for the Polarity puzzle, a logic game where you place magnets on a grid. Each magnet has two ends: a positive (+) pole and a negative (–) pole. The puzzle gives rules for how many positives and negatives must appear in each row and column, and magnets can’t be placed so that two like poles touch.
